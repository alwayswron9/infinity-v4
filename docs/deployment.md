# Deployment

This document provides information about deploying the Infinity v4 application to various environments.

## Build Process

Before deploying, you need to build the application:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build
```

The build process:
1. Compiles TypeScript code
2. Optimizes images and assets
3. Generates static files
4. Creates server-side components

## Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended)

As a Next.js application, the easiest deployment option is Vercel:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import the project in the Vercel dashboard
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy

Vercel automatically detects that it's a Next.js application and configures the build settings accordingly.

### Docker Deployment

For containerized deployments, create a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV production

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Then build and run the Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t infinity-v4 .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e DATABASE_URL=your_db_url infinity-v4
```

### Traditional Hosting

For traditional hosting environments:

1. Build the application locally
2. Set up Node.js on the server
3. Upload the `.next` directory and other required files
4. Install production dependencies
5. Start the server using `npm start`

## Environment Variables

Configure these environment variables for production:

```
# Required
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string (if used)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_pusher_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_pusher_secret
PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_pusher_cluster
```

## Database Setup

Ensure your production database is properly set up:

1. Create the database
2. Apply the schema (from the SQL dump file or migrations)
3. Configure connection pools appropriately for production

## Monitoring and Logging

Consider implementing:

1. Application logging
2. Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
3. Performance monitoring
4. Uptime monitoring

## CI/CD Pipeline

Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments:

1. Run tests on pull requests
2. Build the application
3. Run security scans
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Run integration tests
6. Deploy to production

## Scaling Considerations

For high-traffic applications:

1. Use a load balancer
2. Implement caching strategies
3. Optimize database queries
4. Consider serverless deployment for API routes
5. Use CDN for static assets
