## Introduction

Infinity v4 is a modern web application built using Next.js 15, React 19, and TypeScript. The application appears to be a full-stack application with database integration (PostgreSQL), authentication, and real-time features using Pusher.

## Purpose

Based on the codebase analysis, Infinity v4 seems to be a data-centric application with features for:

- User authentication and authorization
- Data visualization and management
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Model exploration and interaction

## Key Features

From analyzing the project structure and dependencies, Infinity v4 includes:

1. **Authentication System**: Custom authentication using JWT and bcrypt
2. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL for data persistence
3. **Real-time Updates**: Integration with Pusher for real-time features
4. **UI Components**: Comprehensive UI with Radix UI primitives
5. **Data Visualization**: Using Recharts for data visualization
6. **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
7. **State Management**: Using Zustand for global state management
8. **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration

## Target Audience

The application appears to be targeted at users who need to work with data models, explore data, and collaborate in real-time.

## Project Status

This is version 0.1.0 of the application, as indicated in the package.json file, suggesting it's in early development stages.
