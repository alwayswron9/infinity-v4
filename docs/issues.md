# Infinity Implementation Issues

## Compatibility Issues

### 1. Vector Search Inconsistency
**Issue**: System design includes configurable similarity thresholds, but custom similarity metrics are listed as out of scope.
**Resolution**: Documentation updated to explicitly state only cosine similarity is supported.
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 2. JWT Authentication Features
**Issue**: System design includes JWT refresh functionality, but token rotation and refresh token management are listed as enterprise features.
**Resolution**: Removed JWT refresh functionality, clarified tokens are non-refreshable with 24-hour expiration.
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 3. Validation Framework Scope
**Issue**: System design includes Zod for runtime validation, while custom validation rules are listed as out of scope.
**Resolution**: Clarified that Zod will only be used for basic type validation, added detailed validation features to out-of-scope.
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 4. Error Response Detail Level
**Issue**: System design includes detailed error responses with request_id and details, while advanced error tracking is listed as enterprise feature.
**Resolution**: Simplified error responses to basic information (code and message only).
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Internal Inconsistencies

### 5. Model Definition Structure
**Issue**: System design shows nested "fields" object in model definition, but example usage shows flat structure.
**Resolution**: Standardized model definition structure across all documentation.
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 6. API Response Format
**Issue**: Success response format is not consistently defined across different endpoints.
**Resolution**: Standardized response envelope for all API endpoints:
1. Success Response Structure:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {}, // Response payload
     "meta": {   // Optional for list endpoints
       "page": 1,
       "limit": 10,
       "total": 100
     }
   }
   ```
2. Error Response Structure:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": {
       "code": "ERROR_CODE",
       "message": "Human readable message"
     }
   }
   ```
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 7. Vector Search Implementation
**Issue**: Vector search endpoint structure differs between overview and detailed sections.
**Resolution**: Standardized vector search API documentation with consistent response format and explicit cosine similarity support.
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

# Next Steps
1. Update API client libraries to reflect standardized response formats
2. Update integration documentation for workflow platforms
3. Add migration guide for any breaking changes
