## Note to Developers

1. If you find yourself implementing any of these features, stop and consult with the product team first
2. Focus on delivering core MVP features with high quality rather than adding scope
3. Document any requirements or requests related to these features for future consideration
4. Any exceptions to this list must be explicitly approved and documented
5. When in doubt about whether something is in scope, assume it is out of scope and seek clarification
