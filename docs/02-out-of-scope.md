# Out of Scope Features for Infinity MVP

This document defines features and capabilities **NOT** included in the MVP version of Infinity. To maintain clarity and usefulness:

## Scope Management Guidelines

1. **Priority Focus:** This document prioritizes listing features that are:
   - Commonly requested by stakeholders
   - Close to MVP boundary (could be mistaken as in-scope)
   - Enterprise-grade capabilities
   - High development effort items

2. **Maintenance Rules:**
   - Update this document when feature requests are declined
   - Focus on categories relevant to current development phase
   - Remove items that become irrelevant
   - Consolidate similar items under broader categories

3. **Usage Instructions:**
   - Consult with product team before implementing any listed features
   - Document new feature requests that are declined
   - Get explicit approval for any exceptions
   - When in doubt, assume features are out of scope
