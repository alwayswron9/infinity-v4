# Infinity MVP Overview

## Executive Summary
Infinity is a central data service designed as the backbone for your workflow automation platforms (n8n, Make, Zapier). Serving as the single source of truth, it unifies data management, relationship tracking, semantic operations, and workflow coordination. This document outlines the MVP features, integration points, and security measures while hinting at future enhancements.

## What is Infinity?

Infinity is a custom data service designed to integrate seamlessly with workflow automation platforms such as:
- n8n
- Make
- Zapier

Think of these workflow platforms as your workforce, while Infinity serves as:
- The central data store for maintaining consistent, reliable data across all your workflows
- The relationship management system that tracks how different pieces of data connect and interact
- The ontology (or semantic) layer that provides meaning and context to your data structures
- The action management system coordinating operations across your data
- The vector database enabling semantic search and similarity matching

## MVP Scope 

### Data Model Management
- **Features:** 
  - Create, modify, and update data models through a simple interface
  - Define relationships between models (one-to-one, one-to-many)
  - Configure relationship behaviors (e.g., cascade deletes)
  - Support for basic properties (strings, numbers, dates, booleans, arrays, and objects)
- **Validations:** Configure required fields, unique constraints, and data type checks
- **Relationships:** Define and manage relationships between models with automatic foreign key management

### Relationship Management
- Define one-to-one relationships (e.g., User to Profile).
- Establish one-to-many relationships (e.g., Company to Employees).
- View relationship diagrams showcasing how different models connect.  
  *Visual Aid:* 

- Query related data easily via API endpoints.

### Database Actions
- **Operations:**  
  Perform direct CRUD operations on any data model in addition to executing pre-configured actions.
- **Pre-configured Actions:**  
  - Can affect one or more data models in a single operation.  
  - Use partial parameter definitions (templates), where remaining parameters are supplied at execution time.
- **Tracking:** Built-in status monitoring and logging of operations.
- **Interdependency:** Works in tandem with both the Data Model Management and API Features sections.

### Embedding Management
- **Functionality:**  
  Enable or disable vector embeddings at the model level.
- **Implementation:**  
  When enabled, the system automatically adds a 'vector' field using OpenAI's ada-002 embedding model (1536 dimensions) for similarity operations.
- **Operations:**  
  Automatically updates embeddings when source content changes.
- **Use Case:**  
  Ideal for enabling accurate similarity searches across large data sets.

### Infrastructure & Operations
- **Security:**  
  Secure API access using API keys and JWT tokens for user authentication.
- **Monitoring:**  
  Capture detailed logs — including timestamps, service names, log levels, and stack traces — to ensure visibility.
- **Operations Tracking:**  
  API requests, response times, and status codes are tracked for operational insights.

### API Features
- RESTful endpoints for all data models covering:
  - Standard CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Bulk operations for enhanced data handling.
  - Query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination.
- **Interdependencies:**  
  The API integrates tightly with data model management, authentication, and UI components.
- **Security & Authentication:**  
  - API keys are suitable for automated tools (like n8n).
  - JWT tokens are available through the admin UI for browser-based use.
  - CORS configuration further secures API access.

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Logging:**  
  Capture extensive system logs including timestamps, request/response details, and error stack traces.
- **Dashboard:**  
  Display key metrics such as request volume and error rates with visual charts and analytics.
- **Interdependency:**  
  These logs directly support troubleshooting and performance enhancements for API and database operations.

### User Interface
- **Access:**  
  A clean, web-based admin interface enabling users to interact with all system features.
- **Features:**  
  - Interactive data explorer for browsing and querying data.
  - Visualization tools (tables, charts, graphs) for data representation.
  - Filtering, sorting, searching, and export functionalities.
  - Integrated action management and debugging tools.
- **Authentication Management:**  
  Generate and view API keys as well as active JWT tokens.
- **Log Viewing:**  
  Provides integrated search and filtering capabilities for log analysis.
