# Workflow Automation with Infinity

Infinity serves as the central data hub for your automation workflows. This guide will show you how to connect Infinity to n8n and other automation tools to create powerful workflows that leverage your data models.

![Workflow Automation Overview](/docs/images/diagrams/workflow-overview-placeholder.png)

## Introduction to Workflow Automation

Workflow automation connects different systems and triggers actions based on events or schedules. With Infinity as your data source, you can:

- Trigger actions when data changes
- Schedule regular data processing
- Connect multiple systems together
- Reduce manual data entry
- Ensure consistent business processes

## Connecting Infinity to n8n

[n8n](https://n8n.io) is a powerful workflow automation platform that integrates well with Infinity. Here's how to set it up:

### Prerequisites

1. An Infinity account with at least one data model created
2. An API key from Infinity
3. Access to n8n (request credentials by emailing [aiwahlabs@gmail.com](mailto:aiwahlabs@gmail.com))

### Setting Up n8n Connection

1. Log in to your n8n instance at [automate.aiwahlabs.xyz](https://automate.aiwahlabs.xyz)
2. Create a new workflow
3. Add an HTTP Request node as your first step
4. Configure the HTTP Request:
   - Method: GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE (depending on your needs)
   - URL: Your Infinity API endpoint (e.g., `https://infinity.aiwahlabs.xyz/api/public/data/customers`)
   - Authentication: Header Auth
   - Header Name: `X-API-Key`
   - Header Value: Your Infinity API key
5. Test the connection to ensure it's working

## Common Workflow Patterns

### 1. Data Synchronization

Automatically keep data in sync between Infinity and other systems:

1. Trigger: Schedule (e.g., every hour)
2. Action: HTTP Request to external system API
3. Action: Map data to Infinity format
4. Action: HTTP Request to update/create records in Infinity

**Example Use Case:** Sync customer data from your CRM to Infinity.

### 2. Event-Triggered Actions

Perform actions when specific events occur in your data:

1. Trigger: Webhook from Infinity (when a record is created/updated)
2. Action: Conditional logic based on data values
3. Action: Send notifications or perform system actions

**Example Use Case:** Send an email notification when a high-priority support ticket is created.

### 3. Data Enrichment

Enhance your data with information from external sources:

1. Trigger: New record created in Infinity
2. Action: HTTP Request to enrichment API (e.g., company info, geocoding)
3. Action: Update the record in Infinity with the additional data

**Example Use Case:** Enrich customer records with company information from Clearbit.

### 4. Approval Workflows

Implement approval processes for data changes:

1. Trigger: Record updated with status "Pending Approval"
2. Action: Send approval request to responsible person
3. Action: Update record based on approval decision

**Example Use Case:** Approve discount requests from sales representatives.

## Step-by-Step Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Lead Capture Form to CRM

This workflow captures leads from a form and adds them to your CRM:

1. **Create a Form Endpoint in n8n:**
   - Add a "Webhook" node as the trigger
   - Configure it to receive form submissions

2. **Process the Form Data:**
   - Add a "Set" node to format the data
   - Map form fields to your Infinity model fields

3. **Create a Record in Infinity:**
   - Add an "HTTP Request" node
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://infinity.aiwahlabs.xyz/api/public/data/leads`
   - Body: Mapped form data
   - Headers: Include your API key

4. **Send Confirmation Email:**
   - Add a "Send Email" node
   - Configure with recipient, subject, and body
   - Include data from the form submission

### Example 2: Automated Invoice Processing

This workflow automatically processes invoices and updates payment status:

1. **Monitor for New Invoices:**
   - Schedule a regular check for new invoices
   - HTTP Request to Infinity: `GET /api/public/data/invoices?filter=status:pending`

2. **Process Each Invoice:**
   - Loop through invoices
   - Send to payment processor API

3. **Update Payment Status:**
   - HTTP Request to Infinity: `PATCH /api/public/data/invoices/{id}`
   - Update status to "paid" or "failed"

4. **Send Notifications:**
   - Conditionally send emails based on payment status

## Best Practices for Workflow Automation

### 1. Keep Workflows Focused

Design each workflow to do one thing well. Avoid creating complex workflows that try to accomplish too many tasks.

### 2. Handle Errors Gracefully

Include error handling in your workflows:
- Add "Error Trigger" nodes in n8n to catch failures
- Implement retry logic for transient errors
- Send notifications when workflows fail

### 3. Document Your Workflows

Maintain documentation for each workflow:
- Purpose and business value
- Trigger conditions
- Required data and expected outputs
- Dependencies on other systems

### 4. Monitor Workflow Performance

Regularly review workflow execution:
- Check execution logs
- Monitor error rates
- Optimize workflows that run slowly

### 5. Implement Security Best Practices

Secure your automated processes:
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use the principle of least privilege
- Never expose sensitive data in logs

## Advanced Automation Techniques

### Conditional Logic

Use "IF" nodes in n8n to create branches in your workflow based on data values or conditions:

```javascript
// Example condition in n8n
return $input.item.json.total > 1000;
```

### Data Transformation

Use "Function" nodes to manipulate data between systems:

```javascript
// Example transformation in n8n
return {
  fullName: `${$input.item.json.firstName} ${$input.item.json.lastName}`,
  email: $input.item.json.email.toLowerCase(),
  joinedDate: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

### Delay and Scheduling

Implement delays or specific timing for workflow actions:
- Use "Wait" nodes to pause between steps
- Schedule workflows to run at specific times
- Implement retry logic with increasing delays

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API Request Failures

If your HTTP requests to Infinity are failing:
1. Check your API key is valid and has proper permissions
2. Verify the endpoint URL is correct
3. Examine request payload for formatting issues
4. Check API rate limits

### Webhook Issues

If webhooks aren't triggering properly:
1. Verify the webhook URL is accessible from the internet
2. Check webhook configuration in Infinity
3. Ensure the receiving system can handle the payload format
4. Look for firewall or security settings blocking requests

### Data Format Problems

If data isn't being processed correctly:
1. Check for type mismatches (strings vs numbers)
2. Verify date formats are consistent
3. Look for missing required fields
4. Check for special characters or encoding issues
