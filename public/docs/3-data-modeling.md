# Data Modeling in Infinity

Effective data modeling is the foundation of a successful Infinity implementation. This guide will help you understand how to design and implement data models that accurately represent your business needs.

## Understanding Data Models

In Infinity, a data model is a blueprint that defines the structure, relationships, and constraints of your data. Each model represents a distinct type of entity in your business domain, such as customers, products, orders, or tasks.

## Best Practices for Data Modeling

### 1. Start with Business Requirements

Before creating data models, clearly define:

- What information needs to be stored
- How the data will be used
- Who needs access to the data
- What relationships exist between different data types

### 2. Keep Models Focused

Each model should represent a single, well-defined concept. If a model tries to represent too many things, consider breaking it into multiple related models.

**Good Example:**
- A "Customer" model for customer information
- A separate "Order" model for order details
- A relationship connecting orders to customers

**Avoid:**
- A single "Customer_Orders" model that mixes customer data with order history

### 3. Use Descriptive Names

Choose clear, consistent naming for models and fields:

- Use singular nouns for model names (e.g., "Customer" not "Customers")
- Use specific field names that indicate the data's purpose
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across models

### 4. Define Appropriate Field Types

Select the correct field type for each piece of data:

| Data Need | Recommended Field Type |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Names, descriptions | Text |
| Prices, quantities | Number |
| Yes/No flags | Boolean |
| Dates and times | Date |
| Categories with fixed options | Select |
| References to other records | Relation |
| Images, documents | File |
| Complex structured data | JSON |
| AI-searchable content | Vector |

### 5. Establish Relationships

Define how models relate to each other:

- **One-to-Many**: A customer can have many orders
- **Many-to-Many**: Products can belong to multiple categories, and categories can contain multiple products
- **One-to-One**: A user has one profile

## Creating Advanced Data Models

### Required Fields

Mark fields as required when the data is essential. This ensures data integrity by preventing the creation of records without critical information.

### Field Validation

Set validation rules to ensure data quality:

- Text length limits
- Number ranges
- Date boundaries
- Format patterns (email, phone numbers, etc.)

### Computed Fields

Use computed fields to derive values automatically:

1. Click "Add Field" when creating or editing a model
2. Select "Computed" as the field type
3. Define the formula using other fields in the model

**Example:** Calculate a "Full Name" from "First Name" and "Last Name" fields

### Default Values

Set sensible defaults for fields to speed up data entry and ensure consistency:

- Current date for "Created At" fields
- "Active" for status fields
- Common selections for frequently used values

## Real-World Examples

### Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

A CRM implementation might include these models:

1. **Contact**
   - Name (Text, required)
   - Email (Text, with email validation)
   - Phone (Text)
   - Status (Select: Lead, Prospect, Customer, Former)
   - Notes (Text, multiline)
   - Last Contact Date (Date)

2. **Company**
   - Name (Text, required)
   - Industry (Select)
   - Website (Text, URL)
   - Address (Text, multiline)
   - Contacts (Relation to Contact, many)

3. **Opportunity**
   - Name (Text, required)
   - Value (Number)
   - Stage (Select: Qualification, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won, Closed Lost)
   - Close Date (Date)
   - Company (Relation to Company)
   - Contact (Relation to Contact)

### Project Management

A project management system might include:

1. **Project**
   - Name (Text, required)
   - Description (Text, multiline)
   - Start Date (Date)
   - Due Date (Date)
   - Status (Select: Planning, Active, On Hold, Completed)
   - Client (Relation to Company)

2. **Task**
   - Title (Text, required)
   - Description (Text, multiline)
   - Project (Relation to Project)
   - Assignee (Relation to User)
   - Due Date (Date)
   - Priority (Select: Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   - Status (Select: To Do, In Progress, Review, Done)

3. **Time Entry**
   - Task (Relation to Task)
   - User (Relation to User)
   - Date (Date)
   - Hours (Number)
   - Description (Text)

## Evolving Your Data Models

As your business needs change, you may need to update your data models:

1. **Adding Fields**: Add new fields to capture additional information
2. **Modifying Fields**: Change field properties if requirements change
3. **Creating Relationships**: Connect models as new dependencies emerge
4. **Adding Models**: Create new models for emerging business entities

**Note**: Exercise caution when removing fields or changing field types on models with existing data, as this might affect data integrity.
